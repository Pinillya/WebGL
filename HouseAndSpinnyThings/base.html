<!-- 

Welcome to this wonderfull webGLworld of Illy Binfield!
This is a small experiment made for an assignment, in my mobile system class.
its not fantastic but it has tought me a lot. 

This is based a lot on tuts found at: http://learningwebgl.com/blog/
And on my teachers lessons/ script examples. 
Though!! I have smacked it all together all by my lonesom, and made my own aditions. 

Alright, so lets take the tour. I will try to comment a bit, but as this
is so basic, I'm not gonna go to any extreems.

    //Animation pr frame is handled in another function inside "makeGL" What we have here, is us changing the rPyramide and rBox variables based on the current time. We do this so that even if the screen lags, the action that would happen during the time the action was happening, will happen. 
    var lastTime = 0;
    function animate() {
        var timeNow = new Date().getTime();
        if (lastTime != 0) {
          var elapsed = timeNow - lastTime;

          rPyramide += (90 * elapsed) / 1000.0;
